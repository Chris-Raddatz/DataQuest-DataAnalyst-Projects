# Portfolio

A repository for all the projects I completed on DataQuest.


**Exchange Rate.ipynb**
 - A project mainly focusing on the storytelling aspect of data visualization. I took a dataset focused on the EURO exchange rate to other national currencies, focused on the EURO-USD rate, and then presented a figure detailing the fluctations in that ratio from the past twenty years. 

**Hacker News Analysis.ipynb**
- This project was one of the first ones I did through DataQuest, it details the analysis of a forum website named Hacker News. I compared how to different types of posts were responded to by the website's community.

**Traffic_Analysis.ipynb**
- This project was one of the first to focus on visualization. We took a dataset recording traffic data on an interstate and analyzed how different months, weather and time of day affected the amount of traffic recorded. 

**eBay Sales.ipynb**
- This project contains a lot of dataset manipulation and cleaning. It was looking at car sales through eBay and how different factors - brand, age, mileage - affected the price of the car.
