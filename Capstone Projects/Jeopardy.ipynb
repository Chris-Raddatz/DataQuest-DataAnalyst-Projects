    "# Patterns of Jeopardy\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture. Imagine that you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any way to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win."
