# Portfolio

A repository for all the projects I completed on DataQuest.

[**Employee Resignation**](https://github.com/ChrisRad21/DataQuest-Projects/blob/main/Capstone%20Projects/Employee.ipynb)
- A project from the first section of data clean up on the Dataquest 'Data Analyst' pathway. Given two datasets with surveys on employee resignation data and required to combine and then perform a simple analysis. 

[**Exchange Rate.ipynb**](https://github.com/ChrisRad21/DataQuest-Projects/blob/95a29ddcc6b27481942363890a642cc598992fa2/Exchange%20Rate.ipynb)
 - A project mainly focusing on the storytelling aspect of data visualization. I took a dataset focused on the EURO exchange rate to other national currencies, focused on the EURO-USD rate, and then presented a figure detailing the fluctations in that ratio from the past twenty years. 

[**Hacker News Analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/ChrisRad21/DataQuest-Projects/blob/93755507bba14be9c9bd782285b5a8512bb90b9e/Hacker%20News%20Analysis)
- This project was one of the first ones I did through DataQuest, it details the analysis of a forum website named Hacker News. I compared how to different types of posts were responded to by the website's community.

[**Traffic_Analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/ChrisRad21/DataQuest-Projects/blob/93755507bba14be9c9bd782285b5a8512bb90b9e/Traffic_Analysis.ipynb)
- This project was one of the first to focus on visualization. We took a dataset recording traffic data on an interstate and analyzed how different months, weather and time of day affected the amount of traffic recorded. 

[**eBay Sales.ipynb**](https://github.com/ChrisRad21/DataQuest-Projects/blob/93755507bba14be9c9bd782285b5a8512bb90b9e/eBay%20Sales)
- This project contains a lot of dataset manipulation and cleaning. It was looking at car sales through eBay and how different factors - brand, age, mileage - affected the price of the car.
