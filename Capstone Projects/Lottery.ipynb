    "The lottery usually is a fun activity to take part in and hope for a better life. Sometimes, this habit turns into an addiction, with addicts wasting away money and potentially turning to desperate behaviors, like theft, to make up more money to bet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to help a medical institute by building a dedicated mobile app for lottery addicts to better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a dedicated core of engineers to build the app, but we are responsible for the core probabilities that are pivotal for the app functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we will focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that allow users to answer questions like:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data pertinent to this lottery. Our dataset is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) resource from 1982-2018. "
